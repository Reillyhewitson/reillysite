            <h1>CAT <b id="cattrack">TRACK</b></h1>
            <p>Cat Track is an internet connected Cat flap prototype, we were working towards developing this over four weeks with the help of <a href="https://think-eningineer.com">Think Engineer</a>. Whilst we didn't get fully working we made lots of progress and I personally learnt a lot about Kotlin and Planning of projects. You can see the full project <a href="https://github.com/cattrack">here</a>. A special thanks to <a href="https://think-eningineer.com">Think Engineer</a> for all the help and guidance throughout the project. </p>

            <h1>Where's My Milk</h1>
            <p>Where's my Milk is a project I did at my first hackathon early in 2018. We decided to use the equipment given to track cows. The point behind the hackathon was to create a solution that would take advantage of the LoRaWAN network which is built on top of the old analogue TV signals. As such it has an extremely wide range and long battery life; Because of these factors we believed there was a use case for a farmer and consumer to track their cows. See a mockup <a href="https://wheresmymilk.online">here</a>.</p>

        <div id="betweenPages"></div>
        <div id="sec7">
            <h1>FileWrite 2</h1>
            <p>This was my first long-form project. I found it suffered from a lot of feature creep, I managed to get the core feature set done in a week or two, but then decided to add a lot more. The features currently include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a file</li>
                <li>Edit a file (add to only)</li>
                <li>Delete a file</li>
                <li>Change directory</li>
                <li>List files</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I also created a third version of FileWrite: <a href="https://github.com/Reillyhewitson/fileWrite-3">FileWrite 3</a>. This came with a few updates such as being able to change the entire contents of the file and having a GUI. I also wrote it in C# due to Visual Studio's WYSIWYG GUI editor. You can find version 2 at <a href="https://github.com/Reillyhewitson/FileWrite-2">Github</a>.</p>

            <h1>Spotifylist</h1>
            <p>This is a simple program I made to experiment with JSON parsing. I used <a href="https://github.com/plamere/spotipy">Spotipy</a> for user authentication but everything else is custom get requests. The way it works is that you sign in with your spotify account. It then gets a list of the playlists in your account. You select one of these and it uses the playlist ID to get all the songs in your playlist. I have also done a similar thing with reddit using their .json url exstensions e.g. <a href="https://reddit.com/r/all/new.json">reddit.com/r/all/new.json</a>. You can see Spotifylister on Github <a href="https://github.com/Reillyhewitson/spotifylist">here</a>.</p>
